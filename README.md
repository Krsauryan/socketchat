***socketchat***

This is a simple chat application that allows users to connect to a server and exchange messages with other connected users. This chat application is built using Python 3 and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

To run the application, first, start the server by running python server.py in the terminal. This will start the server on localhost at port 8000. You can modify the host and port values in the server.py file as per your requirement.

Once the server is running, start the client by running python client.py in another terminal window. The client will prompt you to enter your username. Enter your desired username and press enter. The GUI chat window will appear, where you can type your message in the input box and send it by clicking the send button or pressing enter. Your messages will be displayed in the chat window along with the messages from other connected users.

The chat 1window has a pink theme with a scrollable chat log.
The chat 2window has a indigo theme with a scrollable chat log.
but you can change it as of requirements in the source code.
This app is made by *kumar sauryan* with simple understanding of computer networks, python and tkinter gui library of python.

Thank you for using this chat application. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to share.
