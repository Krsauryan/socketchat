***socketchat***

This is a simple chat application that allows users to connect to a server and exchange messages with other connected users. This chat application is built using Python 3 and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

To run the application, first, start the server by running python server.py in the terminal. This will start the server on localhost at port 8000. You can modify the host and port values in the server.py file as per your requirement.

Once the server is running, start the client by running python client.py in another terminal window. The client will prompt you to enter your username. Enter your desired username and press enter. The GUI chat window will appear, where you can type your message in the input box and send it by clicking the send button or pressing enter. Your messages will be displayed in the chat window along with the messages from other connected users.

The chat window has a pink theme with a scrollable chat log and times new roman font. The send button is highlighted when the mouse hovers over it.

Thank you for using this chat application. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to share it with us.
